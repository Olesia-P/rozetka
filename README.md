# Project: "Rozetka" homepage copy

At this level, I practised recreating the visual design of the homepage of a well-known online shopping website (rozetka.com.ua), trying to achieve a result as close to the original as possible.

‘Rozetka’ is often updated and changes its design. This project was made some time ago, and now the original site may look a bit different. Note: This project has only a Ukrainian version.
