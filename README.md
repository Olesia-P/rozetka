# Project 2: Visual "Rozetka" homepage copy

Rozetka.com.ua is a famous Ukrainian online shopping website.

I used its homepage as a template for practicing reproducing a **VISUAL** layout as close to the original as possible.

Original “Rozetka” website is often updated and has design changes. **This project was made some time ago, so it can look a bit different from the original now**.

<mark style="background-color: lightgreen">Note: This website has the Ukrainian language version only.</mark>
